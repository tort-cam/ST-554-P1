Each group member should provide feedback on the other group members’ work. Be detailed and specific where possible. The quality of this feedback can play a part in your grade.

You can provide feedback to your group members in many different ways (live in a meeting, offline, or however else you devise) but the feedback must be documented here! 

Please replace “Feedback giver #x” with a group member’s name below and add feedback as a bulleted list below. Note: There is a pencil icon on the top right of the README file (when you are viewing the README.md file) that allows you to edit.

  I enjoy the exposition throughout the process, making it clear what is going on from step to step!
  + I found the approach to not only removing the `-200` values but also tallying them and keeping track of how they were distributed interesting. My own method was much less elegant.
  + Immediately one thing I like about this group project is I can see how other people think about approaching a solution to a problem. I'm learning more about `python` by following your code!
  + Beautiful graphs! I may be misunderstanding regression, but does the `NOx` vs Benzene graph imply strong correlation? I see a clear pattern, sure, but towards the right side of the graph the data seems more uniform and less connected to the regression line.
  + ~~I notice the coefficient for the LRs are enclosed between brackets, i.e., `[` and `]`. Is this a special notation?~~ Further down the code, with the MLRs and multiple coefficients, I now understand why.
  + Very interesting to separate the times by season and not just month!
  + Nice table formatting for the Spearman's correlation coefficients!
  + I can't see the 3d graph and, frankly, I'm afraid to "touch" anything programmatically for fear of messing up your code.
  
  The exposition and work is impressive!
  + I do not have any criticism to add. You have a clear command of the language and I clearly still have a lot to learn, which is fortunate: to countermand Bradbury's Montag, "It [is] a pleasure to [_learn_]."

  This is a really good draft on EDA, nice transitions and sections. I think you did a good data wrangling in pandas and you sectioned the sections well and they logically flow. When you add more text, it will flowly naturally, which is one of the advantages of notebooks and you did a good job. The graphs are nicely designed. I am very critial at my job about viz and your graphs are great. I really like the graphs in "Benzene by Everything (W/SLR). The scatter with the black line really show the trend through the data, even with the noise.

  If you wanted to add more introductory paragraph, I think that would help frame the notebook.
  More code comments would help the reader understand each part. My version needs this as well.
  Summaries between your designed sections could help the reader as well.


  Overall, great job!
