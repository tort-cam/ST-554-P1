Each group member should provide feedback on the other group members’ work. Be detailed and specific where possible. The quality of this feedback can play a part in your grade.

You can provide feedback to your group members in many different ways (live in a meeting, offline, or however else you devise) but the feedback must be documented here! 

Please replace “Feedback giver #x” with a group member’s name below and add feedback as a bulleted list below. Note: There is a pencil icon on the top right of the README file (when you are viewing the README.md file) that allows you to edit.

  I enjoy the exposition throughout the process, making it clear what is going on from step to step!
  + I found the approach to not only removing the `-200` values but also tallying them and keeping track of how they were distributed interesting. My own method was much less elegant.
  + Immediately one thing I like about this group project is I can see how other people think about approaching a solution to a problem. I'm learning more about `python` by following your code!
  + Beautiful graphs! I may be misunderstanding regression, but does the `NOx` vs Benzene graph imply strong correlation? I see a clear pattern, sure, but towards the right side of the graph the data seems more uniform and less connected to the regression line.
  + ~~I notice the coefficient for the LRs are enclosed between brackets, i.e., `[` and `]`. Is this a special notation?~~ Further down the code, with the MLRs and multiple coefficients, I now understand why.
  + Very interesting to separate the times by season and not just month!
  + Nice table formatting for the Spearman's correlation coefficients!
  + I can't see the 3d graph and, frankly, I'm afraid to "touch" anything programmatically for fear of messing up your code.
  
  The exposition and work is impressive!
  + I do not have any criticism to add. You have a clear command of the language and I clearly still have a lot to learn, which is fortunate: to countermand Bradbury's Montag, "It [is] a pleasure to [_learn_]."
