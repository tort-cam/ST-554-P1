Each group member should provide feedback on the other group members’ work. Be detailed and specific where possible. The quality of this feedback can play a part in your grade.

You can provide feedback to your group members in many different ways (live in a meeting, offline, or however else you devise) but the feedback must be documented here! 

Please replace “Feedback giver #x” with a group member’s name below and add feedback as a bulleted list below. Note: There is a pencil icon on the top right of the README file (when you are viewing the README.md file) that allows you to edit.

Hey Bryan! I saw your message on Slack, no worries - I think what you have definitely counts as an acceptable initial draft. I know the second "Using y and another numeric variable x" section is still to come, I look forward to giving feedback on it Monday :) I'm basing my feedback on the rubrics provided in the general "Project 1" pdf.

Introduction
+ You've got a title and author, though I think a summary or general description of the purpose of the notebook would be helpful here. Other than that, great!
	
Narrative & Markdown Use
+ Your markdowns and inline comments look good! My main suggestion would be to manually indent your doc strings within your function definitions. 
+ If you summon your docstring using `help(fn_name)` You'll see how the longer ones (i.e. gridsearch) get a little unwieldy. This is really minor, but I think may make a difference when it comes to final grading.
+ I like how you've delineated the sections of your code w/ markdown indents. I have no problem following the thought process/logic.
+ You may want to include more Markdown cells under the "Grid Search -> Using y and another numeric variable x" section. I know the process is the same as above, but for clarity it may be beneficial to repeat some shortened descriptions.
	
Coding Tasks
+ Your code is organized and works :) We had different approaches to removing and checking the -200 values. Regarding your "Gradient descent" troubles, I'm glad you got it figured out w Dr. Post. No notes from me!
