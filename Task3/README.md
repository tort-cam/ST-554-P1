Each group member should provide feedback on the other group members’ work. Be detailed and specific where possible. The quality of this feedback can play a part in your grade.

You can provide feedback to your group members in many different ways (live in a meeting, offline, or however else you devise) but the feedback must be documented here! 

Please replace “Feedback giver #x” with a group member’s name below and add feedback as a bulleted list below. Note: There is a pencil icon on the top right of the README file (when you are viewing the README.md file) that allows you to edit.

  The exposition clearly outlines what is being done and what is sought.
  + One thing right off the bat: I find it interesting you combined all functions into a single code cell. It never occurred to me I could combine multiple sequential cells into a single one, separated instead by a couple lines.
  + Along with Cameron, it makes me feel like I'm making progress in learning `python` when I see how you both calculate the MSE and I see I took a similar approach.
  + In the section "Load and Clean Data" you say, "the value __-200__ is a missing value _sentinel_." I like that terminology.
  + I like the contrast in how you cleaned up the date/time fields to Cameron's.
  + In particular I like how the output for the functions are formatted, clearly indicating the information conveyed rather than "spitting out numbers" _sans_ explanation.
  + Good conclusion, with the explanation clearly articulated and defended.
  + I'm grateful this is a cooperative rather than a competetive project because I am out of my league. Great job!

Hi Jacob! I've really got no major notes or suggestions for you. Your familiarity with Python is far beyond mine - I learned a lot from reading through your code. I can't seem to open your Task03.ipynb file in colab, but that shouldn't be a problem.
I'm basing my feedback on the rubric provided in the general "Project 1" pdf.

Introduction:
+ Great job on the header and intro information! It's very clear what you plan to do.
+ Small typo  - "This project notebook _aims to predicts_"

Narrative & Markdown Use:
+ Nice very clear headers on each section, outlining what is to come.
+ I appreciate the bold text and bulleted lists
+ Conclusion helps wrap up the task.
+ Unfortunatley, because I can't open it in colab I can't see the "Table of Contents" side tab - So long as each section is its own section (which it looks like is the case), its all good.
+ You may want to add in some inline comments to mark where you are doing each of the tasks you outlined at the beginning of each step, but I think it is pretty clear as is.

Coding Tasks:
+ I've got no suggestions here :)
+ I really like how you put together df_day in pt. 3
